    <p>
      Tipster is a basic pooled tips distributor with a bit of sauce under the
      hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
      (Note: Tipster does not store data anywhere, track users, or remember anything. It momentarily uses the 
      numerical values you input to calculate tips. Beyond that, it's blind. Once
      you close the tab, everything is wiped.)
      </i>
    </p>
    <p><b>How to use:</b></p>
    <p>
      1) Enter each person&#39;s hours worked (for the week, typically) in the
      Hours column. (If you need more rows, click the little person icon to add them.)
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Enter the total amount of tips you wish to distribute among your
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tipster will then calculate the hourly tip rate (by dividing total tips by
      total hours worked) and use that to determine how much out of the total
      pool of tips each person should get, based on how many hours that person
      worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Tipster will also round people&#39;s individual tip earnings to the
      nearest dollar. More on that in a bit.)
    </p>
    <p><b>Example:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For a particular week, 15 people worked a combined total of 200 hours.
          The accumulated tips they earned together totaled $154. This means
          their calculated &#39;hourly tip rate&#39; for that week is 154/200,
          or $0.77 an hour.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Among these 15 people, let&#39;s say JD worked 12 hours. So JD should
          get 12 x 0.77, or $9.24 (if we don&#39;t round) from the total tips
          pile.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We then continue by looking at each person&#39;s individual hours
          worked, tip them one by one according to the hourly tip rate we
          calculated for the week, and by the end, the total tips pile should be
          distributed out.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>But there&#39;s a twist.</b></p>
    <p>
      It&#39;s pretty common practice to give people their tips using whole
      dollar amounts, without any loose change.
    </p>
    <p>So that&#39;s what Tipster does.</p>
    <p>
      From the example above, JD&#39;s tips would typically get rounded from
      $9.24 to the nearest dollar, meaning $9.
    </p>
    <p>
      And everyone else&#39;s calculated tips would get rounded, either up or
      down, depending on what decimal they end in.
    </p>
    <p>But this can cause problems.</p>
    <p>Consider this simple example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>M is owed $1.50 in tips, J is owed $1.45, and A is owed $1.30.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If we round normally, M gets $2, and both J and A get $1. So that&#39;s $4
      combined that they&#39;re owed from the total tips pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But notice that if we hadn&#39;t rounded, they actually would have been
      owed $4.25 from the total pile. In this case, that extra 25 cents gets
      left in the pile, due to rounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we increase the number of people and add more instances of rounding, it
      increases the chances that, by the end, our total tips pile will either
      have some money left over in it after distribution, or worse, too little
      in it to adequately distribute because too many people were rounded up.
    </p>
    <p>
      To handle rounding problems of this type, what Tipster does is try to find
      a <b>rounding threshold</b> that, when applied to everyone equally,
      causes all individual tips to be rounded to whole dollar amounts that,
      when added up, are equal to (or occasionally less than, but never greater
      than) the total tips pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      So taking our simple example above with J, M, and A, Tipster might apply a
      rounding threshold of .45 to all of them. This means that
      Tipster would decide to round all individual tips ending in a decimal of .45
      or greater <em>up</em>, and those ending in a decimal smaller than
      .45 <em>down.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, M would still get $2, but now so would J, while A would still
      get $1.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be clear, Tipster would only do this if, after trying standard rounding
      (where the rounding threshold is .5) on everyone, there was
      money left over in the total tips pile after distribution. In that case,
      Tipster would start lowering the threshold until enough people who were
      close to being rounded up (but weren&#39;t) <em>do</em> get rounded up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
      In other words, Tipster will always do its best to find an optimal
      rounding threshold that causes the <em>entire</em> tips pile to be
      distributed in whole dollar amounts to all the people who worked that
      week.
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Failing that, Tipster will resort to distributing whole dollar tips that
      add up to an amount as close to the total tips pile as possible, without
      going over.
